# 🎵 Claude Notifications Settings

Welcome! This interactive wizard will help you configure notification sounds for Claude Code.

Let's make your Claude experience more delightful with custom audio notifications!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🎯 KEY FEATURE: Interactive Sound Preview

**IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE:**

This setup wizard is INTERACTIVE. Users can preview sounds at ANY time by saying:
- "play [sound_name]"
- "preview [sound_name]"
- "прослушать [sound_name]" (Russian)
- "проиграть [sound_name]" (Russian)

**Your job:**
1. Detect when user wants to preview a sound (keywords: play, preview, прослушать, проиграть)
2. Extract the sound name from their message
3. Run `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sound-preview <path>` to play it
4. Ask if they want to hear more sounds
5. When they're ready, proceed with AskUserQuestion selections

**Flow:**
- Step 1: Check binary installation (auto-install if missing)
- Step 2: Detect system and list available sounds
- Step 3: **INTERACTIVE PREVIEW PHASE** - let user explore sounds freely
- Step 4: Ask 4 questions (Task/Review/Question/Plan) - remind about preview before each
- Step 5: Volume configuration
- Step 5.5: Audio device selection (optional)
- Step 6: Webhook configuration
- Step 7: Generate config.json
- Step 8: Summary & test

**Be patient and encouraging** - sound selection is personal!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 1: Check Binary Installation

First, let me verify the notification binary is installed:

```bash
# Get plugin root directory
# Priority: 1) CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT env var, 2) installed plugin location, 3) current directory
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  # Try the standard installed plugin location
  INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
  if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
  else
    # Fallback to current directory (for development)
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  fi
fi

echo "Plugin root: $PLUGIN_ROOT"
echo ""

# Check if binary exists (platform-agnostic check)
BINARY_EXISTS=false
if [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/claude-notifications" ] || \
   [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/claude-notifications-darwin-amd64" ] || \
   [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/claude-notifications-darwin-arm64" ] || \
   [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/claude-notifications-linux-amd64" ] || \
   [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe" ]; then
  BINARY_EXISTS=true
fi

if [ "$BINARY_EXISTS" = "false" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Notification binary not found. Installing..."
  echo ""
  if ! "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/install.sh"; then
    echo ""
    echo "❌ Error: Failed to install notification binary"
    echo "Please run /claude-notifications-go:notifications-init or check your internet connection"
    exit 1
  fi
  echo ""
  echo "✅ Binary installed successfully!"
  echo ""
else
  echo "✅ Notification binary is already installed"
  echo ""
fi
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 2: Discover Available Sounds

Now let me detect what sound options are available on your system!

```bash
# Get plugin root (re-declare for this bash session)
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
  if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
  else
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  fi
fi

# Detect Operating System
OS_TYPE=$(uname -s)
case "$OS_TYPE" in
  Darwin*)
    echo "Operating System: macOS"
    HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS="true"
    SYSTEM_SOUNDS_DIR="/System/Library/Sounds"
    ;;
  Linux*)
    echo "Operating System: Linux"
    if [ -d "/usr/share/sounds" ]; then
      HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS="true"
      SYSTEM_SOUNDS_DIR="/usr/share/sounds"
    else
      HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS="false"
    fi
    ;;
  MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*)
    echo "Operating System: Windows"
    HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS="false"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Operating System: Unknown"
    HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS="false"
    ;;
esac

# Built-in Sounds
echo ""
echo "Built-in sounds (included with plugin):"
if [ -d "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds" ]; then
  ls -1 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/"*.mp3 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
    name=$(basename "$file" .mp3)
    echo "  ✓ $name.mp3"
  done
else
  echo "  Warning: sounds/ directory not found!"
fi

# System Sounds
if [ "$HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS" = "true" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "System sounds detected at: $SYSTEM_SOUNDS_DIR"

  case "$OS_TYPE" in
    Darwin*)
      # macOS system sounds
      echo "Available macOS system sounds:"
      ls -1 /System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
        name=$(basename "$file" .aiff)
        echo "  • $name"
      done
      ;;
    Linux*)
      # Linux system sounds (varies by distribution)
      echo "Available Linux system sounds (sample):"
      find /usr/share/sounds -type f \( -name "*.ogg" -o -name "*.wav" \) 2>/dev/null | head -10 | while read file; do
        name=$(basename "$file")
        echo "  • $name"
      done
      ;;
  esac
else
  echo ""
  echo "⚠️  No system sounds detected on this platform."
  echo "   Don't worry! You can use the built-in MP3 sounds included with the plugin."
  echo "   They work perfectly on all platforms!"
fi
```

**Always available:**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 3: Interactive Sound Preview 🔊

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE:**

Before asking the user to make final choices, you MUST offer to play sounds for them.

Tell the user:

> 🎵 **Want to hear sounds before choosing?**
> I can play any sound for you! Just say:
> - `"play task-complete"` - Built-in task-complete sound
> - `"play Glass"` - macOS Glass system sound
> - `"preview Hero"` - Preview any available sound
>
> Try as many as you like! When you're ready, I'll ask you to select sounds for each notification type.

**How to handle preview requests:**

When user says "play [sound_name]", "preview [sound_name]", "прослушать [sound_name]", or "проиграть [sound_name]":

1. **Extract sound name** from user message (ignore the command word, keep only the sound name)

2. **Determine the full path** to the sound file:
   ```bash
   # Get plugin root
   PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
   if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
     INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
     if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
     else
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
     fi
   fi

   # For built-in sounds (no extension needed)
   if [[ "$sound_name" == "task-complete" ]] || [[ "$sound_name" == "review-complete" ]] || [[ "$sound_name" == "question" ]] || [[ "$sound_name" == "plan-ready" ]]; then
     SOUND_PATH="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/${sound_name}.mp3"

   # For macOS system sounds
   elif [[ -f "/System/Library/Sounds/${sound_name}.aiff" ]]; then
     SOUND_PATH="/System/Library/Sounds/${sound_name}.aiff"

   # Try common variations
   elif [[ -f "/System/Library/Sounds/${sound_name}.mp3" ]]; then
     SOUND_PATH="/System/Library/Sounds/${sound_name}.mp3"

   else
     echo "❌ Sound '${sound_name}' not found. Available options listed above."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Play the sound** using the sound-preview utility with reduced volume:
   ```bash
   # Get plugin root
   PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
   if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
     INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
     if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
     else
       PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
     fi
   fi

   echo "🔊 Playing: ${sound_name}... (volume: 30%)"
   "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sound-preview" --volume 0.3 "$SOUND_PATH"
   echo "✓ Playback complete!"
   ```

   **IMPORTANT:** Always use `--volume 0.3` (30% volume) when previewing sounds during setup to avoid disturbing the user with loud sounds.

3. **Ask if they want to hear more**:
   > Would you like to:
   > - Hear another sound? (just type "play [name]")
   > - Ready to make your selections? (type "ready")

**Examples of user interactions:**

```
User: play Glass
Claude: [runs bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Glass... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete! Would you like to hear another sound, or ready to choose?"

User: preview task-complete
Claude: [runs bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 sounds/task-complete.mp3]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: task-complete... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!"

User: прослушать Hero
Claude: [runs bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Hero... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!"

User: проиграть Ping
Claude: [runs bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Ping... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!"

User: ready
Claude: "Great! Let's configure your notification sounds..."
[proceeds to Questions 1-4]
```

**Edge cases:**

```
User: play unknown-sound
Claude: "❌ Sound 'unknown-sound' not found. Available sounds are:
  Built-in: task-complete, review-complete, question, plan-ready
  System (macOS): Glass, Hero, Funk, Sosumi, Ping, Purr, Basso, etc.
Try: 'play Glass' or 'preview task-complete'"

User: I want Glass for everything
Claude: "Great choice! Let me confirm - you want Glass for all notification types?
Or would you like to choose different sounds for each type?
(You can still preview other sounds if you'd like)"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Allow users to preview AS MANY sounds as they want before making selections
- Be patient and encouraging - sound selection is personal!
- If a sound name isn't recognized, show the available sounds list again

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 4: Interactive Configuration

Now let's configure your notification sounds! I'll ask you 4 questions - one for each notification type.

**IMPORTANT:** Build the options list dynamically based on what's available:

```bash
# Build options array based on OS and available sounds
OPTIONS=""

# Always include built-in sounds (available on all platforms)
OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}Built-in: task-complete.mp3|Triumphant completion chime (recommended)\n"
OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}Built-in: review-complete.mp3|Gentle notification tone\n"
OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}Built-in: question.mp3|Attention sound\n"
OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}Built-in: plan-ready.mp3|Professional tone\n"

# Add system sounds if available
if [ "$HAS_SYSTEM_SOUNDS" = "true" ] && [ "$OS_TYPE" = "Darwin"* ]; then
  # macOS system sounds
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Glass|Crisp macOS Glass sound\n"
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Hero|Triumphant fanfare\n"
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Funk|Distinctive funk groove\n"
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Sosumi|Pleasant macOS notification\n"
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Ping|Subtle ping sound\n"
  OPTIONS="${OPTIONS}System: Purr|Gentle purr\n"
fi

echo "Available sound options built: $(echo -e "$OPTIONS" | wc -l) options"
```

### Question 1: Task Complete Sound ✅

**Before presenting the question**, remind the user:

> 🎵 **Reminder:** You can still preview sounds! Just say "play [sound_name]" before making your choice.

When Claude finishes a task, which sound would you like to hear?

Use AskUserQuestion with dynamically generated options:

**If macOS with system sounds:**
- question: "Which sound for Task Complete notifications?"
- header: "✅ Task Complete"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  1. **Built-in: task-complete.mp3** - "Triumphant completion chime (recommended)"
  2. **Built-in: review-complete.mp3** - "Gentle notification tone"
  3. **Built-in: question.mp3** - "Attention sound"
  4. **Built-in: plan-ready.mp3** - "Professional tone"
  5. **System: Glass** - "Crisp macOS Glass sound"
  6. **System: Hero** - "Triumphant fanfare"
  7. **System: Funk** - "Distinctive funk groove"
  8. **System: Sosumi** - "Pleasant macOS notification"

**If Linux/Windows (no system sounds):**
- question: "Which sound for Task Complete notifications?"
- header: "✅ Task Complete"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  1. **task-complete.mp3** - "Triumphant completion chime (recommended)"
  2. **review-complete.mp3** - "Gentle notification tone"
  3. **question.mp3** - "Attention sound"
  4. **plan-ready.mp3** - "Professional tone"

**Note:** System sounds are only available on macOS. On other platforms, use the built-in MP3 sounds which work perfectly everywhere!

**CRITICAL:** If user says "play [sound]" instead of choosing, DO NOT call AskUserQuestion yet. First play the sound, then re-ask the question.

### Question 2: Review Complete Sound 🔍

**Before presenting the question**, remind the user:

> 🎵 **Reminder:** You can preview sounds! Just say "play [sound_name]" before choosing.

When Claude completes a code review or analysis, which sound?

Use AskUserQuestion with the same dynamically generated options as Question 1.

### Question 3: Question Sound ❓

**Before presenting the question**, remind the user:

> 🎵 **Reminder:** You can preview sounds! Just say "play [sound_name]" before choosing.

When Claude has a question or needs clarification?

Use AskUserQuestion with the same dynamically generated options as Question 1.

### Question 4: Plan Ready Sound 📋

**Before presenting the question**, remind the user:

> 🎵 **Reminder:** You can preview sounds! Just say "play [sound_name]" before choosing.

When Claude finishes planning and is ready for your review?

Use AskUserQuestion with the same dynamically generated options as Question 1.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 5: Notification Volume Configuration

Now let's configure the volume for your notification sounds.

Use AskUserQuestion with:
- question: "What volume level do you want for notification sounds?"
- header: "🔊 Volume"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  1. **Full volume (100%)** - "Maximum volume (default)"
  2. **High volume (70%)** - "Loud but not maximum"
  3. **Medium volume (50%)** - "Balanced volume"
  4. **Low volume (30%)** - "Quiet, good for offices"
  5. **Very low (10%)** - "Very quiet, minimal distraction"

**Volume mapping:**
- "Full volume (100%)" → `1.0`
- "High volume (70%)" → `0.7`
- "Medium volume (50%)" → `0.5`
- "Low volume (30%)" → `0.3`
- "Very low (10%)" → `0.1`

**Important:** Parse the user's choice and extract the numeric value (e.g., "70%" → 0.7).

**Note:** You can offer to preview a sound at the selected volume:
```bash
# Get plugin root
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
  if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
  else
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  fi
fi

echo "Let me play a quick test at your selected volume..."
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sound-preview" --volume <selected_volume> "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/task-complete.mp3"
echo "How does that sound? (If you want to adjust, just let me know)"
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 5.5: Audio Device Selection (Optional)

You can route notification sounds to a specific audio output device instead of using the system default.

First, list available audio devices:

```bash
# Get plugin root
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
  if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
  else
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  fi
fi

echo "Available audio output devices:"
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/list-devices"
```

Use AskUserQuestion with:
- question: "Which audio output device should play notification sounds?"
- header: "🔊 Audio Device"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  1. **System default** - "Use the system's default audio output (recommended)"
  2. **Specific device** - "Choose a specific audio device from the list above"

If user selects "Specific device":
- Ask them to type the exact device name from the list
- Store the device name for the config file

**Device name mapping:**
- "System default" → `""` (empty string in config)
- Specific device → exact device name as shown by list-devices (e.g., "MacBook Pro-Lautsprecher")

**Note:** Leave `audioDevice` empty to use the system default. This is recommended unless you have a specific reason to route audio elsewhere.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 6: Webhook Configuration (Optional)

Do you want to send notifications to a webhook (Slack, Discord, Telegram)?

Use AskUserQuestion with:
- question: "Enable webhook notifications?"
- header: "🔗 Webhooks"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  1. **No webhooks** - "Desktop notifications only (recommended)"
  2. **Slack** - "Send to Slack webhook (JSON format)"
  3. **Discord** - "Send to Discord webhook (embed format)"
  4. **Telegram** - "Send to Telegram bot (requires chat_id)"
  5. **Custom** - "Custom webhook endpoint (JSON)"

If webhook is enabled, I'll create a placeholder configuration that you can edit later.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 7: Generate Configuration File

Based on your answers, I'll create `config/config.json`:

**Sound Path Construction (Important!):**

Parse the user's choice and construct the correct path:

```bash
# Function to convert user choice to file path
get_sound_path() {
  local choice="$1"

  # Check if it's a built-in sound
  if [[ "$choice" == "Built-in:"* ]] || [[ "$choice" == *".mp3" ]]; then
    # Extract filename
    filename=$(echo "$choice" | sed 's/Built-in: //' | sed 's/^[^:]*: //')
    echo "\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/${filename}"

  # Check if it's a system sound (macOS)
  elif [[ "$choice" == "System:"* ]]; then
    # Extract sound name (e.g., "Glass" from "System: Glass")
    soundname=$(echo "$choice" | sed 's/System: //' | awk '{print $1}')
    echo "/System/Library/Sounds/${soundname}.aiff"

  # Fallback to built-in if parsing fails
  else
    echo "\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/task-complete.mp3"
  fi
}

# Example usage:
TASK_COMPLETE_PATH=$(get_sound_path "$user_answer_1")
REVIEW_COMPLETE_PATH=$(get_sound_path "$user_answer_2")
QUESTION_PATH=$(get_sound_path "$user_answer_3")
PLAN_READY_PATH=$(get_sound_path "$user_answer_4")
```

**Examples:**
- Built-in: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sounds/task-complete.mp3`
- System (macOS): `/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`
- Fallback (if parsing fails): Always use built-in MP3

**Configuration Template:**

**IMPORTANT - Webhook Configuration Rules:**
- If user selected "No webhooks": Set `"enabled": false` and `"preset": "custom"` (DO NOT use "none")
- If user selected "Slack": Set `"enabled": true` and `"preset": "slack"`
- If user selected "Discord": Set `"enabled": true` and `"preset": "discord"`
- If user selected "Telegram": Set `"enabled": true` and `"preset": "telegram"`
- If user selected "Custom": Set `"enabled": true` and `"preset": "custom"`

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "desktop": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sound": true,
      "volume": <user's selected volume>,
      "audioDevice": "<user's selected device or empty string>",
      "appIcon": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/claude_icon.png"
    },
    "webhook": {
      "enabled": <true if webhook selected, false for "No webhooks">,
      "preset": "<slack|discord|telegram|custom - NEVER use 'none', use 'custom' if No webhooks>",
      "url": "<placeholder - user must edit>",
      "chat_id": "<for telegram only>",
      "format": "json",
      "headers": {}
    },
    "suppressQuestionAfterTaskCompleteSeconds": 7
  },
  "statuses": {
    "task_complete": {
      "title": "✅ Task Completed",
      "sound": "<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["completed", "done", "finished", "успешно", "завершен"]
    },
    "review_complete": {
      "title": "🔍 Review Completed",
      "sound": "<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["review", "ревью", "analyzed", "проверка", "analysis"]
    },
    "question": {
      "title": "❓ Claude Has Questions",
      "sound": "<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["question", "вопрос", "clarify"]
    },
    "plan_ready": {
      "title": "📋 Plan Ready for Review",
      "sound": "<user's choice>",
      "keywords": ["plan", "план", "strategy"]
    }
  }
}
```

Write this to: `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/config.json`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 8: Summary & Test

After creating the configuration, show the user:

```
🎉 Configuration Saved Successfully!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 Summary:
  ✅ Task Complete    → <chosen sound>
  🔍 Review Complete  → <chosen sound>
  ❓ Question         → <chosen sound>
  📋 Plan Ready       → <chosen sound>

  🔊 Desktop notifications: ENABLED
  🔊 Volume: <selected volume>%
  🔊 Audio device: <selected device or "System default">
  🔗 Webhooks: <ENABLED/DISABLED>

Configuration file: config/config.json
```

### Test Your Setup

Ask user: "Would you like to test your task-complete notification now?"

If yes:
```bash
# Get plugin root
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  INSTALLED_PATH="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-notifications-go"
  if [ -d "$INSTALLED_PATH" ]; then
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$INSTALLED_PATH"
  else
    PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  fi
fi

echo "Testing task-complete sound at your configured volume (<selected_volume>%)..."
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/sound-preview" --volume <selected_volume> "<path-to-chosen-sound>"
echo "✓ Sound test complete!"
```

**Note:** This test uses your configured volume level. The actual notifications will use this same volume.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Additional Notes

**Editing Later:**
- You can re-run `/claude-notifications-go:notifications-settings` anytime to reconfigure
- Or manually edit `config/config.json`

**Webhook Configuration:**
If you enabled webhooks, you'll need to manually edit `config/config.json` to add:
- **Slack:** Your webhook URL from Slack integrations
- **Discord:** Your webhook URL from Discord server settings
- **Telegram:** Bot token in URL + chat_id field
- **Custom:** Your endpoint URL and any required headers

**Sound Formats Supported:**
- MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG/Vorbis, AIFF
- Cross-platform playback via malgo (miniaudio) library
- Audio device selection supported on all platforms

**System Sounds:**
- macOS: `/System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff`
- Linux: `/usr/share/sounds/**/*.ogg` (varies by distribution)
- Windows: Use custom sounds (system sounds not easily accessible)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Tips for Best Experience

✨ **Sound Selection Tips:**
- Use distinct sounds for different notification types
- Choose sounds that won't be disruptive in your workspace
- Test sounds at your typical volume before finalizing

🎯 **Recommended Combinations:**

**Minimal Setup:**
- Task Complete: Glass (crisp, professional)
- Review Complete: Tink (subtle)
- Question: Sosumi (attention-grabbing)
- Plan Ready: Ping (gentle reminder)

**Power User Setup:**
- Task Complete: Hero (celebration!)
- Review Complete: Purr (satisfaction)
- Question: Funk (stand out)
- Plan Ready: Submarine (unique)

**Built-in Sounds:**
- Use the included MP3s if you want consistent cross-platform experience
- Plugin sounds work on all operating systems
