## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- **Subagent notification control** - New config option `notifyOnSubagentStop`
  - Prevents premature "Completed" notifications when Task agents (subagents) finish
  - Main Claude session continues working without distracting notifications
  - Default: `false` (notifications disabled for subagents)
  - Users can enable via `"notifyOnSubagentStop": true` in config if desired
  - Fixes issue where Plan/Explore agents triggered completion notifications while Claude was still thinking

### Changed
- SubagentStop hook now checks config before sending notifications
- Split SubagentStop and Stop hook handling for better control

### Technical Details
- Added `NotifyOnSubagentStop` boolean field to `NotificationsConfig` struct
- Updated hook handler in `internal/hooks/hooks.go` to respect config setting
- Added comprehensive tests for both enabled and disabled states
- All existing tests pass with new functionality

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Volume control on macOS** 🔊
  - Replaced `effects.Volume` with `effects.Gain` for reliable volume control
  - Volume settings (e.g., 30%) now work correctly on macOS
  - Simplified volume conversion logic (linear instead of logarithmic)
  - Affects both notification sounds and `sound-preview` utility
  - All tests passing with new implementation
- **GitHub Actions build step** - Windows builds now work correctly
  - Added `shell: bash` to build step for all platforms
  - Resolved PowerShell syntax error preventing Windows builds from completing

### Changed
- Simplified `volumeToGain()` function - removed complex logarithmic calculations
- Updated documentation in code to reflect linear gain formula: `output = input * (1 + Gain)`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Missing sound-preview binary** - fixes `/notifications-settings` sound preview
  - Added `sound-preview` utility to build system
  - Now built for all platforms (darwin, linux, windows)
  - Included in GitHub Releases
  - Supports interactive sound preview during settings configuration
  - Handles MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, AIFF formats

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- **New notification type: API Error 401** 🔴
  - Detects authentication errors when OAuth token expires
  - Shows "🔴 API Error: 401" with message "Please run /login"
  - Triggered when both "API Error: 401" and "Please run /login" appear in assistant messages
  - Priority detection (checks before tool-based detection)
  - Added comprehensive tests for API error detection

### Improved
- **Binary size optimization** - 30% smaller release binaries
  - Production builds now use `-ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath` flags
  - Binary size reduced from ~10 MB to ~7 MB per platform
  - Faster download times for users (5 seconds instead of 8 seconds)
  - Better privacy (no developer paths in binaries)
  - Deterministic builds across different machines
  - Development builds unchanged (still include debug symbols)

### Changed
- Updated notification count from 5 to 6 types in README
- All tests passing with new features

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- Critical bug in duration calculation ("Took" time in notifications)
  - User text messages were not being detected in transcript parsing
  - `GetLastUserTimestamp` now correctly parses string content format
  - Duration now shows accurate time (e.g., "Took 5m" instead of "Took 2h 30m")
  - Tool counting now accurate (prevents showing inflated counts like "Edited 32 files")
- Added custom JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for `MessageContent` to handle both string and array content formats

### Technical Details
- Fixed `pkg/jsonl/jsonl.go`: Added `ContentString` field and custom `UnmarshalJSON`/`MarshalJSON` methods
- User messages with `"content": "text"` format now properly parsed (previously only array format worked)
- All existing tests pass + added new tests for string content parsing

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Linux ARM64 support for Raspberry Pi and other ARM64 Linux systems (#2)
  - Native ARM64 runner (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`) for reliable builds
  - Full audio and notification support via CGO
  - Automatic binary download via `/notifications-init` command

### Fixed
- Webhook configuration validation now only runs when webhooks are enabled (#1)
  - Previously caused "invalid webhook preset: none" error even with webhooks disabled
  - Preset and format validation now conditional on `webhook.enabled` flag

### Changed
- Documentation updates for clarity and platform-specific instructions
